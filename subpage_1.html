    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <div class="description">   
        <p>
                Fire accidents, also known as fires, are uncontrolled and often destructive incidents involving the combustion of materials, leading to the release of heat, light, and various gases. These accidents can occur in a wide range of settings, including homes, industrial facilities, forests, and urban areas</p>

        <h1>PRE-CAUTIONARY MEASURES</h1>
        <div class="ind_steps">
            <h1>1</h1>
            <p>The first and most crucial step is to alert others to the fire. Shout "Fire!" to inform people in the vicinity. If possible, activate the fire alarm system. Evacuate the area immediately, moving away from the fire to a safe location. Do not use elevators during a fire.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ind_steps">
                <h1>2</h1>
                <p>Dial the emergency services number (e.g., 911 in the United States) to report the fire. Provide the dispatcher with your location, a description of the fire's size and location, and any information about potential hazards or trapped individuals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ind_steps">
                <h1>3</h1>
                <p>If the fire is small and contained, and you are trained to use a fire extinguisher, attempt to extinguish the fire. Remember to use the P.A.S.S. technique:Pull-Aim-Squeeze-Sweep</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ind_steps">
                <h1>4</h1>
                <p> If there's smoke, stay close to the ground where the air is cooler and less toxic. Smoke rises, and the cleanest, coolest air is closest to the floor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ind_steps">
                    <h1>5</h1>
                    <p>When evacuating a building, close doors behind you to slow the spread of the fire and smoke. If you are trapped in a room, seal gaps around doors and vents with cloth or tape to prevent smoke from entering.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ind_steps">
                    <h1>6</h1>
                    <p> If you are in a public or workplace setting, follow established evacuation procedures and muster points. Avoid using elevators and use stairwells if necessary. Do not re-enter the building until authorities declare it safe to do so.</p>
