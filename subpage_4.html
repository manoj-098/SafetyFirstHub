    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <div class="description">   
        <p>A flood alert is a notification issued by meteorological or environmental agencies to inform residents and authorities about the imminent or ongoing threat of flooding in a specific area. Flood alerts are typically categorized based on the severity of the flood risk and can range from minor flooding to life-threatening situations.

        <h1>PRE-CAUTIONARY MEASURES</h1>
        <div class="ind_steps">
