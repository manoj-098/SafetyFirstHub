    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <div class="description">   
        <p>Lightning and thunderstorms are natural atmospheric phenomena that occur when there is an electrical discharge in the atmosphere during a storm. Lightning is the visible discharge of electricity, often occurring as a bright flash across the sky, and it is accompanied by the sound of thunder. Thunder is the result of the rapid expansion of the air heated by the lightning bolt. Thunderstorms can vary in intensity from mild, with brief and localized lightning, to severe, with intense electrical activity, heavy rain, strong winds, and even hail.
