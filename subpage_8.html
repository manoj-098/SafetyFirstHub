    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <div class="description">   
        <p>Radiation accidents can result from equipment malfunction, human error, or natural disasters. They may involve the release of radioactive materials, such as radioactive isotopes, from containment, leading to potential exposure to ionizing radiation. These accidents can have immediate and long-term health and environmental consequences.
