        <h2>Heart Attacks</h2>
    </div>
    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <div class="description">   
        <p>A heart attack typically occurs when a coronary artery, which supplies blood to the heart muscle, becomes blocked by a blood clot or a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque. This blockage restricts blood flow to the heart, leading to damage or death of heart tissue. Common symptoms include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness, and pain radiating to the arm, neck, jaw, or back.
